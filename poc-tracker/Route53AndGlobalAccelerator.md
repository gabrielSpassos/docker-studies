## Route 53 vs Global Accelerator

Both **Route 53** and **Global Accelerator** help route user traffic, but they solve different problems.

### Why Use Route 53?
- 🌐 **DNS Resolution** – Translates domain names (e.g., `example.com`) into IP addresses.  
- ⚖️ **Traffic Routing Policies** – Weighted, latency-based, geolocation, failover, etc.  
- 📝 **Domain Registration** – Buy and manage domains directly in AWS.  
- ❤️ **Health Checks** – Detects unhealthy endpoints and reroutes traffic.  

**Best for:**  
- Managing domains and DNS.  
- High-availability routing with DNS policies.  
- DNS-based global failover.

---

### Why Use Global Accelerator?
- ⚡ **Performance Boost** – Routes traffic over the AWS **global backbone instead of the public internet**.  
- 🌍 **Static Anycast IPs** – Provides two fixed global IPs as a single entry point.  
- ❤️ **Fast Failover** – Detects unhealthy endpoints in seconds and reroutes automatically.  
- 🛠️ **Traffic Control** – Shift traffic between regions with traffic dials.  

**Best for:**  
- Real-time, latency-sensitive apps (gaming, video, fintech, APIs).  
- Multi-region apps needing instant failover.  
- Apps that require consistent global IP addresses.

| Feature           | Route 53                                 | Global Accelerator                          |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Type**          | DNS service                              | Networking service (global traffic router)  |
| **Routing Level** | DNS-based (before connection starts)     | Network-based (after DNS resolution)        |
| **IP Addresses**  | Resolves domain → endpoint IPs           | 2 static anycast IPs for global entry       |
| **Performance**   | Public internet routing (variable)       | AWS global backbone (low-latency, reliable) |
| **Failover Speed**| Minutes (depends on DNS TTL)             | Seconds (continuous health checks)          |
| **Use Case**      | Domain management, DNS, basic routing    | Low-latency global routing, instant failover|

👉 **In short**:  
- Use **Route 53** to manage domains and DNS records.  
- Use **Global Accelerator** when you need **better performance, static IPs, and near-instant failover across regions**.
