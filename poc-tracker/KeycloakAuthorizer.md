## Keycloak Authorizer with User Credentials

**Keycloak** is an open-source Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution that provides **authentication** and **authorization** for applications and APIs.  
When used as an **authorizer with user credentials**, Keycloak issues tokens (e.g., JWT) that clients use to securely access protected resources.

### Key Features
- 🔑 **Authentication** – Validates user credentials (username/password, social login, SSO).  
- 🛡️ **Authorization** – Issues access tokens (JWT or opaque) with user roles and permissions.  
- 📦 **Standards-Based** – Supports **OAuth 2.0**, **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**, and **SAML**.  
- 🧩 **Integration** – Works with apps via REST APIs, SDKs, or reverse proxies.  
- 🛠️ **User Management** – Centralized user store with groups, roles, and federation options (LDAP, Active Directory).  
- ♻️ **Token Lifecycle** – Access tokens, refresh tokens, and single sign-out support.  

### Flow with User Credentials
1. 👤 **User Login** – User provides credentials (username/password).  
2. 🔄 **Token Request** – App exchanges credentials with Keycloak’s **token endpoint**.  
3. 🎟️ **Access Token Issued** – Keycloak returns an access token (JWT).  
4. 🔐 **Authorized Access** – Client includes token in requests to protected APIs.  
5. ✅ **API Validation** – The API or Gateway verifies the token with Keycloak before granting access.  

### Common Use Cases
- 🚀 **Secure APIs** with token-based authentication.  
- 🌍 **Single Sign-On (SSO)** across multiple applications.  
- 🎮 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for fine-grained permissions.  
- 🔄 **Federated Identity** with external providers (Google, GitHub, LDAP, etc.).  

👉 In short: **Keycloak acts as an identity broker and authorizer, issuing tokens based on user credentials to secure APIs and applications.**
